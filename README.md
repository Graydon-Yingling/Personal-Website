# Personal-Website
Some functions do not work as of Feb 13th, but I will continue to make improvements.

02/15/2024: Added Functionality to the Resume button and also added links to the three mentioned projects on the website. Made the contact buttons more responsive as they used to jumble up on mobile screen sizes.


02/22/2024: After finishing both my portfolio and personal site last week, I received feedback from a peer and updated and then moved all project functionality to another page. Now my personal site showcases a few projects, but I have a separate projects site within it which describes and links to them.
